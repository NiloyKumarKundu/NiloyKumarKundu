Hello, I'm Niloy Kumar Kundu, an AI enthusiast and researcher. I graduated from the United International University (UIU) in the Computer Science and Engineering department. My journey includes working on Image Classification, Image Segmentation, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), and a bit of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using deep learning.

Currently, I'm diving into Multi-Modal Machine Learning (MMML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). I enjoy competitive programming and thrive on problem-solving. My goal is to explore how AI can make a real impact on our world. Thank you :smile:
