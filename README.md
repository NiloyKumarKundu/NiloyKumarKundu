I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Engineering and extensive experience in developing and deploying advanced machine learning and deep learning models across diverse industries, including agriculture, and healthcare.

Currently, at Nodes Digital Limited, I have led the development of cutting-edge projects such as E-Irrigation, where I applied deep learning algorithms and attention mechanisms to build a custom regression model that achieved exceptional predictive accuracy. My role encompassed the entire pipeline from data collection and manual annotation to image preprocessing, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and Keras-Tuner. Additionally, I have been pivotal in the E-Fisheries project, where I conducted comprehensive literature reviews, statistical analysis, and feature engineering to optimize machine learning models for enhanced predictive performance.

My research contributions include serving as a Research Assistant at United International University, focusing on radiomics feature extraction for NSCLC subtype classification. This work, funded by the Institute of Advanced Research and affiliated with Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences, Germany, showcases my ability to apply machine learning techniques to complex healthcare challenges.

I also have a strong portfolio that reflects my proficiency in MLOps and full-stack development. For example, I developed a custom deep-learning model for estimating the water height in a rice-growing field using computer vision and image processing. I utilized FastAPI for deployment on the production server.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, and SQL. I am also skilled in version control (Git & GitHub), database management, and project management tools like ClickUp.

I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. I hold certifications in Supervised Machine Learning from DeepLearning.AI and Intro to Machine Learning from Kaggle. My active participation in the tech community is reflected in my published conference papers and competitive programming achievements.

I am passionate about utilizing machine learning to drive innovation and deliver impactful solutions, and I am eager to contribute to projects that challenge my skills and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
